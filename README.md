This is a little side project to understand the concept of enums and how they can be helpful in some situations.

An enum type is a special data type that enables a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined.
A perfect example would be- days in a week, which is fixed. 

public enum Day{
  MOMDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}
